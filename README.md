# Biodegradation Diagnostic Tool (Biodegrade-diag)
A diagnostic pipeline for conservation practice for mold-contaminated paper-based relics is presented in this repository. The web-based tool (https://biodegrade-diag.streamlit.app/) allow users to use the deep learning models to classify mold strains based on microscopic images of the mold-contaminated regions on paper. Then, the web-based platform provides interactive features to investigate expert microbiology knowledge regarding the strain as well as allowing users to contribute to the data collection (both the image database and the expert knowledge base).
